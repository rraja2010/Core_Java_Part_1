/*This program tells you how to get input from user in a java program. 
 * We are using Scanner class to get input from user. 
 * This program firstly asks the user to enter a string and then the string is printed, 
 * then an integer and entered integer is also printed and finally a float and it is 
 * also printed on the screen. Scanner class is present in java.util package so we import
 * this package in our program. We first create an object of Scanner class and then we use the
 * methods of Scanner class. Consider the statement

 Scanner a = new Scanner(System.in);

Here Scanner is the class name, a is the name of object, new keyword is used to allocate the memory and System.in is the input stream. Following methods of Scanner class are used in the program below :-
1) nextInt to input an integer
2) nextFloat to input a float
3) nextLine to input a string */
