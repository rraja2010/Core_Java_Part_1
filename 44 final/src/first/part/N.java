/*
VVI
When we program execution starts, control enters to the main method, and finds N n3 = new N(). 
	It creates object of N and while creating object it has to instantiate all its instance variables 
		which includes N n1 = new N(), so it again creates a new N object and loads all instance variables in 
			that and there also it finds same N n1 = new N(), so it again creates the N object and 
				this will continue until the stack is overflowed.

This can be solved just by changing N n1 = new N(); to N n=null;
