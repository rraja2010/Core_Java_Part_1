/*

Java allows method overloading. In the same manner, the programmer can do constructor overloading in java. 
	A constructor can also be overloaded as a method. 
		We can overload the constructor with different parameter lists. 
			We can arrange the constructors in a way that each constructor performs a different task. 
				The compiler is differentiated by the number of parameters in the list and their types.
